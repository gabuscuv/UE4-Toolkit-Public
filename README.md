# UE4-Toolkit-Public
A set of Scripts for an experience more CLI/CI related with UE4 Project Builds. (and unattended)

For now, only available for GNU/Linux (soon for Windows when I will start my Project for OculusSDK)

Only tested on Gentoo, I think all the tools I used are vanilla/default (I mean without any exotic/special USE or FLAG compilation) but I didn't test it.
